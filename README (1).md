## 🧭 A Bit About Me

Somewhere between math, meaning, and machines — that's where I like to live.  
I’m currently studying **Electronics & Communication Engineering at NIT Warangal**, but most of my learning happens outside the classroom: building offline AI tools, testing LLMs on low-end CPUs, or dreaming up privacy-first alternatives to today's connected world.

I don’t just want AI to be powerful — I want it to be **accessible, private, and personal**.

## 🛠️ What I'm Building (and Breaking)

### 🧠 Blaze - The Local AI Chatbot  
Built with token-efficient models like Phi-3 and LLaMA 3. It runs entirely offline — no cloud, no surveillance, just fast responses and clean UI.

### 🔍 Lens: AI Image Detector  
A tiny tool that figures out if an image was AI-generated. I made it for people who want to trust what they see again.

### 🖼️ AI Photo Search  
Give it a blurry memory (“sunset at the fort”), and it finds the photo. Uses Qwen-VL with keyword indexing — because search should *feel* like remembering.

### 🔐 IPv6 Secure Messenger  
Peer-to-peer messaging using raw IPv6, encrypted from end to end with AES + ECDH. No third parties. No plaintext IPs. Just connection.

### 📄 Resume Screener (RAG-style)  
A live coding challenge that turned into something I’m proud of. PDFs → embeddings → Gemini → answers with citations.

## 💡 What Keeps Me Up at Night

- Can we run powerful AI *entirely offline*, even on modest hardware?
- How do we decentralize communication without sacrificing usability or safety?
- What does an *honest*, human-centered AI tool even look like?

## 🧰 I’m Comfortable With...

`Python`, `PyTorch`, `FAISS`, `ONNX`, `LangChain`, `Diffusers`, `Qwen`, `LLaMA`, `Phi-3`, `Gradio`, `Hugging Face`,  
`WebRTC`, `IPv6`, `ECDH`, `AES-GCM`, `Electron`, `Google Colab`, `Linux`

## 🧪 What I'm Learning Now

- How to fine-tune vision-language models efficiently
- How to obfuscate peer traffic to avoid tracking
- How to turn thoughts into working code, without losing the “why” behind the build

## ✨ A Tiny Win I’m Proud Of

I filed **2 patents** recently — one for offline SDXL image generation, and another for AI-powered workflow automation. They’re not game-changing, but they represent something I deeply believe in: that AI should empower individuals, not just institutions.
